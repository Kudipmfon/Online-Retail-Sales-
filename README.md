Introduction

The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast online retail sales. It aims to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve customer engagement and optimize sales strategies.

Project Objectives

Predictive Modeling: Classify transactions based on purchasing behavior.
Clustering Analysis: Identify customer and product segments.
Feature Engineering: Develop meaningful features from transactional data.
Sales Forecasting: Predict future sales trends using time-series models.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.
Data Description

The dataset used for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains transactional records of online retail purchases. It includes:

Invoice Number: Unique identifier for transactions.
Stock Code: Unique identifier for products.
Description: Name of the product.
Quantity: Number of units purchased.
Invoice Date: Date of transaction.
Unit Price: Price per unit.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for customers.
Country: Country of purchase.
Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics
Missing value treatment
Outlier detection and handling
Data visualizations (purchase trends, top-selling products)
Feature Engineering
Creating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores
Deriving time-based features (e.g., day of the week, seasonality)
Encoding categorical variables
Customer Segmentation
Applying RFM Analysis to segment customers
Visualizing customer segments using bar charts and scatter plots
Clustering Analysis
K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
Evaluation using silhouette scores and elbow method
Interpretation of clusters
Predictive Classification Model
Building a classification model to predict purchasing behavior
Feature importance analysis
Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
Sales Forecasting
Time series analysis of sales data
Application of models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM
Evaluating forecast accuracy using RMSE and MAE
Results & Insights

Key findings from clustering and classification models
Sales forecasting trends and accuracy metrics
Business insights derived from data analysis



## Business Recommendations

Targeted Marketing: Use customer segmentation insights for personalized promotions.
Inventory Management: Optimize stock levels based on sales predictions.
Customer Retention Strategies: Identify high-value customers and create loyalty programs.
